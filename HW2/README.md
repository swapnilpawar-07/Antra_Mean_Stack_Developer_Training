This homework demonstrates a responsive webpage layout designed entirely with **HTML5** and **external CSS** (no inline or internal CSS).

## Features

- **Fixed Navigation Header**
  - Implemented with an unordered list (`<ul>`).
  - Uses custom circular bullets for each menu item.

- **Three-Column Layout**
  - Created using CSS Flexbox (`display:flex`).
  - Each column contains lorem ipsum placeholder text for demonstration.
  - Responsive design collapses to a single column on smaller screens.

- **Fixed Footer**
  - Contains two unordered lists: navigation links and social links.
  - Custom circular bullets match the design of the header.
